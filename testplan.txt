Test 9: Tested for not enough arguments passed in.
> ./a.out
  
  output:
  FATAL ERROR: not enough arguments were passed in, please specify sorting flag and file name

Test 10: Tested for sorting flag not being passed in as the first argument.
> ./a.out ./testChar -i
  
  output:
  FATAL ERROR: please pass in a flag for type of sort as the first argument

Test 11: Tested for incorrect sorting flag being passed in.
> ./a.out -w ./testChar
  
  output:
  FATAL ERROR: please pass in either -i for insertion sort or -q for quick sort

> ./a.out -i ./fakeFile
  
  if "./fakeFile" does not exist

  output:
  FATAL ERROR: the file that was passed in does not exist
